a) computeEllipseParameters.py gives four output files (two for each lepton category - ElEl and MuMu):

    1) sigmas_MuMu(ElEl).json: contains, in order: mbb, mllbb, width_bb, and width_llbb, where mbb(llbb) is the mean of a 1D gaussian fit performed on the invariant mass distribution of bb(llbb) and width_bb(llbb) is the sigma (not resolution!) of the mentioned gaussian fit.

    2) ellipseParam_MuMu(ElEl).json: contains, in order: mbb, mllbb, a, b, theta, MA, MH, where mbb and mllbb are the recontructed masses described at point 1), a, b, and theta are the ellipses parameters coming from a 2D gaussian fit of the 2D mbb VS mllbb histograms, MA and MH are the simulated masses.
